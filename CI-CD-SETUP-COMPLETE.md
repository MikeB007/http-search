# 🚀 HTTP Search - CI/CD Pipeline Implementation Complete

## ✅ What's Been Created

### 🐳 Containerization
- **Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build for production optimization
- **docker-compose.yml**: Production deployment configuration
- **docker-compose.dev.yml**: Development environment with hot reload
- **.dockerignore**: Optimized Docker build context

### 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`):
  - Automated testing and linting
  - Docker image building and pushing to GitHub Container Registry
  - Deployment automation (customizable for your target environment)

### 🛠️ Build Scripts
- **setup-certificates.js**: Cross-platform certificate generation
- **deploy.sh**: Linux/macOS deployment automation
- **deploy.bat**: Windows deployment automation
- **Updated package.json**: New npm scripts for all deployment scenarios

### 📝 Documentation
- **DEPLOYMENT.md**: Comprehensive deployment guide
- **Environment configuration**: Support for both development and production

### 🔐 Security Features
- HTTPS-first architecture
- SSL certificate management
- Secure Docker container setup with non-root user
- Environment-based configuration

## 🎯 Deployment Options Available

### 1. Local Development
```bash
npm run setup:certs    # Setup SSL certificates
npm run serve:https    # Start HTTPS server locally
```

### 2. Docker Development
```bash
npm run docker:dev     # Development with hot reload
```

### 3. Docker Production
```bash
npm run docker:run     # Production deployment
```

### 4. Automated Deployment
```bash
# Linux/macOS
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Windows
scripts\deploy.bat
```

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline
- Push to `main`/`master` branch triggers automatic deployment
- Pull requests trigger testing and building
- Manual deployment available via GitHub Actions

## 🔧 Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Install Docker (if not already installed)
- **Windows**: Download Docker Desktop from docker.com
- **Linux**: `sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose`
- **macOS**: Download Docker Desktop from docker.com

### 2. Test the Pipeline
```bash
# Test certificate setup
npm run setup:certs

# Test Docker build (requires Docker)
npm run docker:build

# Test local HTTPS server
npm run serve:https
```

### 3. Configure Production Certificates
- Replace `./certs/localhost.p12` with CA-signed certificate
- Update `SSL_PASSPHRASE` environment variable
- Configure domain names in certificate

### 4. Customize Deployment Target
Edit `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` deploy section for your specific target:
- SSH deployment to remote server
- Kubernetes cluster deployment
- Cloud platform deployment (AWS, Azure, GCP)

### 5. Security Hardening
- Use secrets management for production passwords
- Configure firewall rules
- Set up monitoring and logging
- Implement backup strategies
